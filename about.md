### Me:

I'm Alex. Born and raised in Washington state, I made the move to Michigan in 2015 where I now happily reside with my wife and two children. I've been working with computers since I was old enough to dismantle one with a screwdriver. In my spare time I enjoy woodworking, small-scale farming, and pretentious coffee.
 
### My background:

While I originally focused on music education in college, I decided to pursue my passion with computers instead, earning a degree in Network Administration. Since then, I've continued my education by earning certifications from Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Who I serve:

I've supported personal clients, engineering firms, software security startups, you name it. In that time, I've had the opportunity to support PC, Mac, and Linux users, as well as both in-house and cloud-based servers in AWS and Azure.

### My goal for you:

It is all too common for individuals and small business owners to be frustrated with a lack of options when it comes to IT support. My goal is to take the guesswork and frustration out of IT. Whether you're trying to back up your family photos, run a business that relies on a dependable network, or just have the peace of mind that your systems are safely being maintained, I will work hard to provide honest pricing, transparent communication, and efficient work.
